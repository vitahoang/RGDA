# Load the Anscombe's quartet data
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet 
Anscombe's quartet comprises four data sets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics, yet have very different distributions and appear very different when graphed 
```{r}
library(Tmisc)
data(quartet)
print(quartet)
```

Now review the mean and sd of each set
```{r}
quartet %>% 
  group_by(set) %>% 
  summarize(mean(x), sd(x), mean(y), sd(y), cor(x,y))
```
# Plotting them to see the different
```{r}
ggplot(quartet, aes(x,y)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + facet_wrap(~set)
```
